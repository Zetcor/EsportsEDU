                A MOBA, short for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, is a real-time strategy video game in which two teams of players,
                usually 5 players per team, compete against each other on a predetermined battlefield. Each player controls a single
                character with a set of unique abilities that improve as the game progresses. Players can also upgrade their characters
                by buying items using gold gained from completing objectives or killing enemy characters. Generally, there are some
                towers that will shoot your creatures on the way, and maybe a few other nuances, but that’s the gist of it. Kill the
                base, win the game. Simple enough.

                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>The origin of the first MOBA game is often debated by gamers. Many claim that the 1989 Sega game Herzong Zwei is the
                first MOBA game ever created while others argue the “Precinct Assault” mode, featured in the 1998 game Future Cop: LAPD,
                is the first real MOBA.
                    </p>
                <p>
                Regardless of who came first, most gamers will agree that Aeon of Strife, a custom StarCraft map, is the game that best
                started the genre’s movement in the pre 2000’s. In 1998, Blizzard Entertainment released StarCraft, one of their
                best-selling real-time strategy (RTS) PC games. The game included a suite of game editing tools called StarEdit that
                allowed users to design and create custom maps with custom rules and gameplay. StarCraft modder, Aeon64, created a
                custom map named Aeon of Strife that became immensely popular with the StarCraft community. Many of the key features
                found in Aeon of Strife eventually became the base structure for all future MOBAs.

                <h3>Rise of the MOBA Genre</h3>
                <p>By 2008, the popularity of Dota had attracted commercial attention. Since the format was tied to the Warcraft property,
                developers began to work on their own "DOTA-style" video games. In late 2009, Riot Games' debut title League of Legends
                was released. It was initially designed by Steve Feak, one of the original creators of Dota: Allstars, who went on to
                apply many of the mechanics and lessons he learned from the mod.

                Despite more than a decade on the market, the genre of MOBA, where League of Legends (LoL) and Dota 2 are still among
                the biggest MOBA games worldwide, have consistently rank among the most-watched games on streaming platforms.
                Additionally, both LoL and Dota 2 are inextricably linked with the growth of eSports and the two legacy titles still
                have some of the most attractive eSports tournament prize pools across all competitive titles - in 2024, the cumulative
                Dota 2 eSports prize pool was worth almost 24 million U.S. dollars.
