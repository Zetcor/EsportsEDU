								<p>
									First-Person Shooter (FPS) is a popular video game genre where
									players experience the action from the viewpoint of the
									character they control. This first-person perspective places
									the player directly into the characterâ€™s shoes, making the
									gameplay feel immersive and intense. The genre is known for
									its fast-paced action and typically features highly detailed
									3D environments that players explore as they engage in combat
									scenarios.
								</p>
								<p>
									Core mechanics of FPS games involve gun-based combat, where
									players aim and shoot at enemies using a variety of weapons
									ranging from pistols to advanced futuristic arms. Precision,
									quick reflexes, and strategic movement are essential for
									success. Many FPS titles also include additional elements like
									team-based objectives, character customization, and
									story-driven missions, further enriching the gameplay
									experience.

									<h3>Origins</h3>
									<p>
										The early roots of first-person shooter (FPS) games can be
										traced back to Maze War (1974) and Battlezone (1980), which
										introduced players to early first-person experiences.
										However, the real breakthrough came with Wolfenstein 3D
										(1992) by id Software, often called the "grandfather of FPS
										games" for setting the foundation of the genre.

									<h3>Rise to Fame</h3>
									<p>
										Following that success, DOOM (1993) and Quake (1996) pushed
										the FPS genre even further into the mainstream by delivering
										faster action, better graphics, and full 3D environments.
										During this time, multiplayer deathmatch and LAN play became
										massive, turning FPS games into highly competitive and
										social experiences.

								<p>
									First-person shooters (FPS) remain one of the most popular and
									rapidly evolving genres in gaming today. Modern titles like
									Valorant, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series and Warzone,
									Counter-Strike 2, Rainbow Six Siege, and Overwatch 2 continue
									to dominate the scene, each offering different takes on the
									core FPS formula. The genre has expanded into several
									subcategories, such as tactical shooters that emphasize
									slower, team-focused gameplay, battle royales that feature
									large-scale, survival-based matches, and hero shooters that
									mix traditional shooting mechanics with unique character
									abilities. Additionally, FPS games are now adapting to Virtual
									Reality (VR), offering players even more immersive and
									physically interactive experiences, pushing the boundaries of
									what the genre can be.
