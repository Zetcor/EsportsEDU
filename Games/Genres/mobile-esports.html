								<p>
									Mobile Esports is competitive gaming played on smartphones and
									tablets, where players or teams compete in tournaments for
									prizes, rankings, and recognition. It includes popular games
									like Mobile Legends, Call of Duty: Mobile, PUBG Mobile, and
									Honor of Kings. These games are designed for mobile controls
									and attract large audiences through live-streamed matches and
									official leagues.
								</p>
								<p>
									What makes mobile esports unique is its accessibilityâ€”anyone
									with a mobile device can join or watch. This has led to rapid
									growth in regions like Southeast Asia and India. Backed by
									publishers and sponsors, mobile esports now features
									professional teams, large prize pools, and global
									competitions, making it a major part of the esports industry.
