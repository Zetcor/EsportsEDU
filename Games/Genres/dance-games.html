							and scores them based on accuracy, timing, and performance. With vibrant visuals, energetic music, and engaging
							routines, "Just Dance" provides an entertaining and interactive experience for individuals or groups, promoting both fun
							and physical activity.

								Just Dance features intuitive and engaging game mechanics that revolve around motion tracking and rhythm-based
								performance. Players are required to mimic the dance moves of on-screen characters in time with popular songs, using
								motion-sensing technology such as smartphones (via the Just Dance app), Kinect sensors, PlayStation Cameras, or Nintendo
								Joy-Con controllers. The game analyzes the player’s movements based on accuracy, timing, and positioning. As players
								dance, they receive real-time feedback in the form of ratings like “OK,” “Good,” “Perfect,” or “Super,” depending on how
								closely their movements match the choreography. Consistently accurate moves build combos and streaks, helping players
								increase their overall score. At the end of each performance, players are awarded a final score and can earn stars or
								ranks based on their performance. These mechanics create an energetic and competitive environment, encouraging players
								to improve their skills while enjoying physical activity.

							Beat Saber is a virtual reality (VR) rhythm game developed by Beat Games, a Czech studio now part of Oculus Studios.
							Released in 2019, the game is available on platforms such as Meta Quest, PlayStation VR, and PC VR systems. In Beat
							Saber, players wield two glowing sabers—typically red and blue—to slice through oncoming blocks that represent musical
							beats. These blocks are arranged in sync with the rhythm of various songs, creating an immersive and energetic
							experience. The game's neon-lit environments and dynamic visuals enhance the futuristic atmosphere, making it both a
							musical and physical challenge.

								Beat Saber features immersive and fast-paced rhythm-based gameplay that requires players to use two virtual sabers to
								slice through blocks that approach in sync with the music. Each block is color-coded and marked with an arrow indicating
								the direction it should be cut. Players must move their arms precisely and rhythmically to match the beat, scoring
								points based on the accuracy, angle, and timing of each slice. In addition to slicing blocks, players must also dodge
								obstacles such as walls and avoid hitting red “bomb” blocks, as mistakes decrease the energy bar. If this bar is
								completely drained, the level ends in failure. The game offers multiple difficulty levels—from Easy to Expert+—along
								with different modes including Solo, Campaign, Multiplayer, Party, and Practice. Modifiers can be applied to increase
								challenge or assist with learning, and on PC, players can add custom songs and visuals for enhanced replayability. The
								mechanics combine musical precision with physical movement, making Beat Saber both a game and a cardio workout.

									Beat Saber tournaments revolve around players demonstrating their skill in slicing virtual reality blocks with precision and speed using motion controllers, all while keeping rhythm with music. These competitions can range from online leaderboards and local gatherings to more organized tournaments that test accuracy, dexterity, and style across different songs and difficulty levels. Platforms like Game.tv facilitate community-run Beat Saber esports tournaments, with prizes varying depending on the host. There are also university-hosted tournaments, indicating a growing competitive scene within the VR gaming community.

						<div class="game-description">
							Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) is a pioneering rhythm-based video game created by Konami, first released in 1998. It
							became a major cultural phenomenon, especially in arcades and home consoles, by blending dance and music. In DDR,
							players stand on a dance pad equipped with four arrows (up, down, left, and right) and must step on the corresponding
							arrows that appear on the screen, following the rhythm of the music. The game features a wide range of music genres,
							from pop and dance tracks to original compositions, and it allows players to compete for high scores based on how well
							they match the steps in time with the beat.

								The core gameplay of DDR revolves around players stepping on arrows on a dance pad in time with the music. As notes
								(arrows) appear on the screen, they move toward the top of the screen in sync with the music. When an arrow reaches a
								target zone, the player must step on the corresponding arrow on the dance pad. The accuracy of each step is graded from
								"Perfect" to "Miss," and the game scores the player based on how well they follow the rhythm and timing of the music.
								The difficulty levels range from beginner to expert, with faster tempos and more complex patterns as players progress.
								DDR includes several game modes, such as solo play, duet, and challenge modes, where players compete to score the
								highest points or achieve the best performance. DDR is also known for being physically demanding, offering an excellent
								cardiovascular workout while having fun.
