                                Counter-Strike 2 is a 5v5 tactical first-person shooter that emphasizes precise gunplay, economy management, and team-based strategy. In each match, two teams—Terrorists (T) and Counter-Terrorists (CT)—compete with opposing objectives: the Terrorists aim to plant a bomb, while the Counter-Terrorists must defend the site or defuse the bomb. The first team to win 13 rounds in competitive mode claims victory. Core features include realistic weapons and recoil mechanics, while new additions in CS2 include the Source 2 engine, which enhances graphics, lighting, and smoke physics, as well as improved matchmaking, a higher tick rate, and an updated user interface and sound system.

                                Overwatch is a team-based hero shooter that originally featured 6v6 matches in Overwatch 1 and now uses a 5v5 format in Overwatch 2. The game’s objectives vary depending on the mode, including escorting payloads, capturing control points, or playing on hybrid maps that combine both elements. It uses a role-based system where players choose from three roles: Tank, who absorb damage and create space for the team; Damage, who focus on eliminating threats and dealing damage; and Support, who heal and provide buffs to keep teammates alive and effective in combat.
