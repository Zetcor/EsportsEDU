								eFootball is designed to simulate the intricacies of football.
								Player control is highly responsive, with dribbling, skill
								moves, and specific player attributes influencing movement and
								performance. Passing mechanics include short, long, and through
								balls, each with varying accuracy based on the player’s
								abilities. Shooting allows for different shot types, including
								powerful and finesse shots, with the timing and placement
								crucial for scoring. Defending mechanics involve tackling,
								interceptions, and player positioning, where precise timing is
								needed to regain possession or prevent goals. The game’s realism
								comes from how these mechanics interact, emphasizing strategy,
								skill, and timing in every match.
