                Fighting games are a competitive genre where players choose characters from a roster of unique fighters, each with their own set of moves, strengths, and abilities. These characters then engage in one-on-one battles, typically within an enclosed arena, where the goal is to deplete the opponent’s health bar before time runs out or the opponent depletes your own. 
             </p>
              <p>
                The gameplay is structured in rounds, with each round offering the opportunity to execute a combination of attacks, counters, and special moves to gain the upper hand. Players often need to master precise timing, reflexes, and specific input combinations to unleash powerful moves or defend effectively against their opponent’s actions. The complexity of the game comes not only from learning these complex input sequences but also from reading and predicting the opponent’s moves, creating a dynamic blend of strategy, skill, and execution.
