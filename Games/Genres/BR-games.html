							PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a popular online multiplayer battle royale game developed by PUBG Corporation
							and released in 2017. The game set the stage for the rise of the battle royale genre, where 100 players are dropped onto
							an island and fight to be the last one standing. The objective is to scavenge for weapons, armor, and other resources
							while staying within a shrinking safe zone. Players must eliminate others while avoiding being killed themselves,
							creating intense, strategic, and action-packed gameplay. PUBG is known for its realistic graphics, large-scale maps, and
							a variety of game modes, offering both solo and team-based experiences.

							<div class="game-description">
								In PUBG, players are dropped onto a large island without any equipment and must find weapons, ammunition, armor, and
								other items scattered throughout the map. As the game progresses, the playable area shrinks, forcing players into
								smaller zones and increasing the intensity of confrontations. The game can be played in several modes, including solo,
								duo, and squad, with players either working alone or as part of a team to survive. The map is filled with various
								environments such as towns, forests, and open fields, all of which present different tactical advantages and challenges.
								Players need to carefully manage their resources, including health items, and plan their movements to avoid being caught
								in the shrinking "blue zone." Combat is a mix of close-range, mid-range, and long-range encounters, requiring players to
								adapt their strategies based on available gear and environmental factors. Players can also drive vehicles, adding an
								extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. The last player or team remaining alive is crowned the winner.

								In Fortnite, players are dropped onto a large map and must scavenge for weapons, materials, and items scattered
								throughout the environment. Players can mine resources (wood, stone, and metal) to build structures that provide
								protection, elevation, or tactical advantages. The playable area gradually shrinks, forcing players into close proximity
								with one another, leading to intense battles. The last player (or team) remaining is declared the winner. Fortnite
								features various weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to sniper rifles and explosives, each with its own advantages
								and range. Players can also use vehicles (such as the Battle Bus or cars in certain modes) to traverse the map quickly.
								Additionally, the game introduces new items and mechanics regularly, keeping the gameplay fresh. The combination of
								shooting, building, and frequent updates makes Fortnite a fast-paced, dynamic experience.

								In Apex Legends, 60 players are divided into 20 squads of 3 players each. Players are tasked with fighting their way
								across an ever-shrinking map, scavenging for weapons, armor, and other resources while eliminating rival squads. One of
								the key mechanics in Apex Legends is the use of Legends, each with unique abilities that provide strategic advantages,
								such as healing teammates, creating decoys, or deploying smoke screens. The game also introduces unique movement
								options, including wall-running, sliding, and using ziplines, which contribute to its dynamic and high-speed gameplay.
								
								The map features a variety of terrains, including open fields, dense forests, and urban environments, providing both
								cover and open spaces for combat. Players must carefully choose their landing spot to gather loot, plan their
								strategies, and position themselves advantageously. The shrinking "ring" forces players into more concentrated areas,
								ensuring that the game builds toward intense, final confrontations.
