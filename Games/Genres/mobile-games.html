							League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the otherâ€™s base. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

								Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in professional-level play. Two teams of five champions battle to destroy the enemy's Nexus. Players choose unique champions with specific roles and abilities, navigating the Summoner's Rift map with its lanes and jungle. They gain strength by earning experience and gold through defeating minions, monsters, and enemy champions, using these resources to level up and buy items. Securing objectives like turrets, inhibitors, elemental dragons, and Baron Nashor provides strategic advantages. Ultimately, teamwork, map awareness, and skillful play are essential to outmaneuver the enemy and achieve victory by destroying their Nexus.
