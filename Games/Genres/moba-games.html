							During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting
							experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat
							the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team
							wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their

								Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends
								and the most prominent in professional-level play. Two teams of
								five champions battle to destroy the enemy's Nexus. Players
								choose unique champions with specific roles and abilities,
								navigating the Summoner's Rift map with its lanes and jungle.
								They gain strength by earning experience and gold through
								defeating minions, monsters, and enemy champions, using these
								resources to level up and buy items. Securing objectives like
								turrets, inhibitors, elemental dragons, and Baron Nashor
								provides strategic advantages. Ultimately, teamwork, map
								awareness, and skillful play are essential to outmaneuver the
								enemy and achieve victory by destroying their Nexus.

								which increases the hero's stats, and at most levels the hero
								gains a skill point which can be spent to unlock or upgrade one
								of the hero's abilities. Alongside a hero's fixed abilities,
								each hero has 6 inventory slots which can be filled with Items
								which provide various benefits and abilities. To purchase these
								items, Gold is gained passively over time, by killing creeps, by
								killing enemy heroes and by destroying buildings.
