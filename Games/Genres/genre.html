                Mobile Esports is competitive gaming played on smartphones and tablets, where players or teams compete in tournaments for prizes, rankings, and recognition.

                What makes mobile esports unique is its accessibility—anyone with a mobile device can join or watch. This has led to rapid growth in regions like Southeast Asia and India. Backed by publishers and sponsors, mobile esports now features professional teams, large prize pools, and global competitions, making it a major part of the esports industry.
