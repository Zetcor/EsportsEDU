                                The League of Legends World Championship began in 2011 as the crowning event of Riot Games’ competitive League of Legends ecosystem. Initially held during DreamHack Summer in Sweden, the tournament has grown into one of the largest and most influential annual esports events in the world. From its modest beginnings with a $100,000 prize pool and eight teams, the event now includes 22 teams representing top-tier regional leagues. Over the years, Riot Games has refined the qualification process, established franchised leagues (LCK, LPL, LEC, and LCS), and enhanced global representation with the introduction of Play-Ins and the Swiss Stage. Worlds is now synonymous with high production values, elite-level gameplay, and an enormous international fanbase.

                                The 2023 and 2024 League of Legends World Championships (Worlds) feature 22 teams, with further refinements expected in future editions. Teams qualify through regional leagues such as the LCK, LPL, LEC, and LCS, with additional representation from regions like the PCS, VCS, LJL, CBLOL, and LLA. The tournament begins with the Play-In Stage, where lower-seeded teams compete in a double-elimination format to secure spots in the Main Event.
							</p>
                            <p>
                                Following the Play-In, the Swiss Stage involves 16 teams competing in a five-round Swiss format, where three wins advance teams and three losses lead to elimination. The top eight teams progress to the Knockout Stage, a single-elimination bracket with all matches played as best-of-five (Bo5). Worlds is a truly global tournament, rotating host cities annually to enhance fan engagement and competitive integrity, with match formats varying from best-of-one (Bo1) to best-of-five (Bo5) across stages.

							<p>
                                The prize pool for The International varies each year but typically ranges between $2 million and $3 million. In addition to the direct prize money, Riot Games funds extra incentives through in-game item sales, such as Championship skins, with a portion of the revenue generated being distributed among the participating teams. Based on trends from 2022–2023, the prize distribution for the top teams generally includes around $500,000 to $600,000 for 1st place, approximately $300,000 for 2nd place, and scaled amounts for the remaining teams based on their placements. Even teams eliminated in the Play-In Stage receive a share of the prize pool, ensuring that all teams are supported, with a focus on promoting sustainability within the competitive scene. Additionally, the revenue generated from in-game cosmetic skins continues to be a major source of income for teams and serves as a way for the community to engage and support their favorite players.
