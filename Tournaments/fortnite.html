                                The FNCS (Fortnite Champion Series) was introduced by Epic Games in 2019 as Fortnite’s official ongoing competitive league. While FNCS initially consisted of online seasonal competitions, the FNCS Global Championship was introduced as the cumulative international finale, bringing together the best duos from around the world.
							</p>
                            <p>
                                The Global Championship acts as the pinnacle of the FNCS ecosystem, following a year of rigorous regional competitions and point-based qualification systems. Though the first in-person Fortnite World Cup in 2019 was a landmark event, the Global Championship now functions as the spiritual successor, marking the peak of Fortnite’s esports calendar. The event’s reintroduction as a LAN event in 2023 signaled Epic’s renewed commitment to high-tier, live competitive Fortnite.
