                                The International was inaugurated in 2011 by Valve Corporation as the inaugural tournament for Dota 2, held during Gamescom in Cologne, Germany. It instantly garnered global attention due to its then-unprecedented $1.6 million prize pool, fully funded by Valve. Over the years, The International has become a benchmark in esports, with its prize pool consistently breaking industry records—peaking at over $40 million in 2021. The introduction of the Battle Pass system in 2013 allowed fans to contribute to the prize pool, revolutionizing funding models in esports.
                                TI has evolved significantly, moving across different host cities including Seattle, Vancouver, Shanghai, Bucharest, and Singapore. The competition has maintained its prestige and competitive rigor, drawing the world’s best Dota 2 teams and serving as the conclusion of the annual Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) season.

							<p>
                                The International is one of the most prestigious tournaments in esports, featuring 18 of the top Dota 2 teams from around the world. Twelve teams qualify by earning points throughout the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) season, while six more secure their spots through regional qualifiers across North America, South America, Europe, China, and Southeast Asia. Once at the tournament, teams are split into two groups for a round-robin Group Stage. The top four teams in each group move to the upper playoff bracket, while those finishing fifth to eighth drop into the lower bracket.

                            <p>
                                The Main Event follows with a double-elimination playoff bracket, where teams must lose twice to be eliminated. Most matches are best-of-three, except for the Grand Final, which is a best-of-five series. Held in a major global city, the event is played entirely on-site to ensure fairness and create a thrilling experience for fans. The International is a celebration of elite competition and the global Dota 2 community.

                                The International’s prize pool is funded through a mix of Valve’s base contribution and community support via in-game Battle Pass purchases, resulting in some of the largest payouts in esports. TI10 in 2021 set the record with over $40 million, while other editions like TI9 and TI11 offered $34 million and $18 million, respectively. The first-place team typically takes around 45% of the total, with second place receiving about 13–15%, and the rest distributed across lower placements. This structure not only rewards top competitors but also ensures meaningful earnings for all participants, reinforcing community involvement in the event’s success.
