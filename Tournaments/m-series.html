                                The M-Series World Championship began with M1 in 2019 as the premier global event for Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB), a mobile Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) developed by Moonton Games, a subsidiary of ByteDance. The series was created to bring together the best MLBB teams from across the globe in an annual competition to crown the world champion.

                            <p>
                                Since its inaugural edition in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the M-Series has grown substantially in scale, viewership, and global participation. Each edition of the tournament introduces broader regional qualifiers, improved production standards, and expanded prize pools. By M5 in 2023, the series featured over 20 teams from six continents and hit viewership peaks exceeding 5 million concurrent viewers — making it one of the largest mobile esports events worldwide.

							<p>
                                The M-Series World Championship hosts 16 to 22 elite Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) teams, which qualify through regional leagues like the Mobile Legends: Professional League (MPL), regional qualifiers, and wild card spots. The tournament promotes global representation, featuring teams from regions including Southeast Asia, Brazil, North America, MENA, Latin America, EECA, and South Asia. The event starts with a Wild Card Stage, giving emerging teams a chance to secure a place in the Main Stage.
							</p>
                            <p>
                                The Main Group Stage divides the teams into four groups, each containing four to six teams. They compete in a round-robin format with Best-of-3 matches, where the top two teams from each group advance to the Upper Bracket of the Playoffs. The Playoffs follow a double-elimination format, with Upper Bracket teams having a second chance, and most matches being Best-of-5. The tournament concludes with a Best-of-7 Grand Finals, held offline at a LAN venue for optimal gameplay conditions and a live audience experience.
