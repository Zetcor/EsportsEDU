                                The PUBG Global Championship was officially introduced in 2019 as the ultimate culminating event in the competitive calendar for PUBG: Battlegrounds, developed by PUBG Studios under KRAFTON Inc. It succeeded the previous PUBG Global Invitational (PGI) series, refining the competitive structure into a more coherent, global system. Since its inception, PGC has brought together the world’s best teams from various regional leagues for a grand offline finale.

                                The PUBG Global Championship (PGC) features 32 top-tier teams drawn from four major regions: Asia, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Americas. Teams qualify through strong performances in regional competitions like the PUBG Continental Series (PCS) and select global partner invitations. The tournament spans multiple phases, beginning with a Group Stage where two groups of 16 teams (Groups A and B) compete across three days with reshuffled matchups to ensure balanced play.

                            <p>
                                The top eight teams from each group advance to the Winners Bracket, where the best eight secure Grand Finals spots, while the bottom eight head to the Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ). Meanwhile, earlier-eliminated teams battle in the Losers Bracket for a second shot at the finals. The Grand Finals stage includes 16 teams competing over 18 to 20 matches, with points awarded for placement and kills—ultimately crowning the team with the highest score as the PUBG World Champion.

In 2023, the total prize pool surpassed $2.5 million USD, with over $600,000 USD awarded to the 1st place team and approximately $250,000 USD given to the runner-up. Teams placing between 3rd and 5th received between $150,000 and $100,000 USD. The remaining prize money was distributed among the top 16 teams, alongside additional bonus awards for Most Valuable Player (MVP), most kills, and best play.
