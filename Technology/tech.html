                                In competitive gaming, both high-end PCs and modern consoles play crucial roles by delivering the performance needed for intense play. Custom-built systems and standardized consoles alike contribute to smooth, responsive gameplay. Here's what sets them apart and powers them up:
                                <ul class="bullet-list">
									<li>
										High-end gaming PCs use processors like Intel Core i9 and AMD Ryzen 9 for seamless multitasking and gaming performance.
									</li>
									<li>
										NVIDIA RTX 4080 or 4090 graphics cards provide high frame rates and stunning visual fidelity.
									</li>
									<li>
										Consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X offer consistent performance across all units for fair competition.
									</li>
									<li>
                                        Custom-built PCs often include liquid cooling and overclocked components for peak performance.
                                    </li>
									<li>
										NVMe SSDs drastically cut loading times and boost system responsiveness in fast-paced matches.
